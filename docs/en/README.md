## Code Name

Aiur (Protoss Planet). Planet Aiur is the home of the Protoss in the *StarCraft* universe. The planet is full of forests; An ancient civilization, Xel'Naga, once ascended the planet and transformed the Protoss. However, the Protoss became an enemy of Xel'Naga and civil war with each other. During this period, known as the Aeon of Strife, the planet suffered great damage. But then The Protoss soon rebuilt their homes and began colonizing them around.

In the plot of *StarCraft*, the planet Aiur is always the center of the Protoss. The Supreme Council here (Protoss Conclave) rules the entire Protoss Society. At the same time, thanks to the power of a Piece of Khaydarin Crystal left behind by the Xel'Nagars, there is a huge claustrophobic matrix on the planet Aiur - on which all the Protoss rely on to build spiritual links for energy (later moved to Shakuras).

In the second chapter, the Zerg invades the planet Aiur. The Overmind even descends on its surface. But in the third chapter that followed, The Protoss fought tenaciously against the Zerg and destroyed the Overmind at the last minute through the sacrifice of the leader, Tassadar. In this battle, more than 70 percent of Protoss died. At the suggestion of the Dark Templar Caste Zeratul, the surviving Protoss withdrew the planet Shakuras, the home of the Dark Templar Caste, through a space portal (Warp Gate).

In *StarCraft*, Aiur is still a desolate planet. The Zerg wreak havoc on the planet and walk aimlessly. At the same time, many of the Protoss on Shakuras have been planning to return to Aiur to rebuild their once-glorious civilization.
